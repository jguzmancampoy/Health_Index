# Health_Index

This repository contains the two csv files as well as the code as a juyter notebook file that was used to produce the graphs and results quoted in the MSc Security and Resilience thesis paper.
The data was pulled from https://www.ghsindex.org/ and I take no credit for the collection of it or the Global Health Security Index generation as my study focuses on reviewing certain aspects of the index and proposing modifications that can, in my opinion, yield a significant improvement in usability of the index by incorporating the concept of causality and also provide a more up to date picture of a country's general score by combining the GHS index efforts with three additional datasets and a sentiment analysis approach.

Please note that the ipynb file was run in a remotely hosted Google Colab environment which means that the file dimensions.csv, additional_data.csv, and sentiment_analysis.csv will need to be downloaded and uploaded to Google Colab in order to replicate the results.

The dimensions sheet in the data.xlsx contains the adjusted scores for the 7 countries where extra data was available
